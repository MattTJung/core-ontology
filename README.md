# The PMD Core Ontology (PMDco) 

This is version v3.0.0 of the PMD Core Ontology (PMDco). 

Introduction

The Platform MaterialDigital core ontology (PMDco) is a mid-level ontology for materials science and engineering (MSE). The PMDco provides bridging mid-level concepts for detailed description of processes, experiments, and computational workflows enabling the reproducibility of process and materials data. These general MSE concepts are designed to be extendable for specific applications within application ontologies. The PMDco is designed in a collaborative effort within the MaterialDigital initiative and intended to be easily used by MSE domain experts.

Folders: 
 - ```modules```    modules of the PMD ontology
 - ```patterns```    patterns describing the use of the modules and show examples
 - ```shapes```    shapes to describe the sets of conditions and constraints of use formally
