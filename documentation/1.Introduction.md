The ontology Metadata4Ing is developed within the homonymous workgroup of the NFDI Consortium NFDI4Ing with the aim of providing a thorough framework for the semantic description of a generic process for the generation of scientific data (let it be an experiment, an observation, or a simulation), with a particular focus on engineering sciences and neighbouring disciplines. The structure and application of the ontology are based on the principles of modularity and inheritance.

Metadata4Ing defines classes and properties or reuses such classes and properties from other ontologies to describe research processes and research data management in NFDI4Ing.
New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing.

Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers.
Instead, it tries to make reuse of existing identifiers for classes and properties by reusing all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology.

In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing.

Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level.
To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item.

Metadata4Ing reuses elements from the following ontologies:

* BIBO = Bibliographic Ontology  
* BIRO = Bibliographic Reference Ontology  
* DCAT = Data Catalog  
* DCC = Digital Calibration Certificate  
* DCTERMS = Dublin Core Terms  
* EMMO = European Materials and Modelling Ontology  
* FOAF = Friend of a Friend  
* OBO = Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies:
  * BFO = Basic Formal Ontology  
  * RO = Relation Ontology  
* OWL = Web Ontology Language  
* PIMS-II = PIMS Interoperability Infrastructure  
* PROV = Provenance Namespace  
* QUDT = Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types  
* RDF = Resource Description Framework  
* RDFS = RDF Schema  
* SCHEMA = schema.org  
* D-SI = Digital System of Units  
* SKOS = Simple Knowledge Organization System  
* SSN = Semantic Sensor Network Ontology  
* VANN = Vocabulary for Annotating vocabulary descriptions  
* XSD = XML Schema Definition  

Furthermore, Metadata4Ing includes a set of indviduals denoting [_roles in the research data management process_](#http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Role), which are taken from the DataCite Metadata Schema v4.4 (see citation in section 5).

## How to read this documentation

Metadata4ing models a part of the world by introducing classes and properties. A **class** stands for a group of individuals that all share some common properties. A **subclass** stands for a subset of this group. For example, the class *method* stands for the concept of a scientific method in general; *microscopy* could be a subclass of *method* representing all microscopy methods and *coherent anti-Stokes Raman microscopy* is an **instance** of these classes, i.e. a  **named individual** belonging to the class *method* and the subclass *microscopy*.

Properties that are attributes of a class are called **datatype properties**. A *method* has for example a *name* as a datatype property. The **range** of a property defines the data type of a property. A *name* can for example have the range *literal*, a *start date* the range *date*. A property's **domain** lists the classes that have this property as an attribute. 

Relations between classes that can be used to interlink instances of these classes are called **object properties**. A *tool* *implements* a *method*, so "*implements*" is an object property with the domain *tool* and the range *method*.

This documentation lists all the classes, datatype properties, object properties and individuals that are defined by m4i or reused from other ontologies.
